# NQueens
NQueens task with MinConflicts algorithm

The goal is to set the N queens on board N*N, in a way that none of them is in conflict with other.

The input value is an integer - larger or equal to 4. This task is realised for university course, 
the requirement is to work for 10 000 under 1sec.

When the algorithm is done, it outputs the time needed in microseconds to set the queens and move them around until there is not conflict between them.
If you want to see the board itself - uncomment the b.print() line;
